Template Literals:
This is a concept where we can insert variables in console by using "backticks- ` ` ".
For instance: 
let boy1 = "Shihab";
let boy2 = "Faysal";

console.log(`${boy1} is friend of ${boy2}`);

using backticks will similarly print the output as a string like we use double quotes to print the strings.
but the only difference is that with backticks we can insert the variables as shown in the example above.

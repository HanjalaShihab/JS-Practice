//Use of Array.from() method:

let name = "Shihab";

let a = Array.from(name);

console.log(a);

//We can that name = "Shihab" was a string but by using Array.form() method we turned that into Array.
//And **Array.from() method is specially used to turn the HTML Collections into array.Where we can't use forEach() function.


let LangName = "JavaScript";

let b = Array.from(LangName);

console.log(b);

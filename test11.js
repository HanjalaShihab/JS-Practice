//Program to find the sum using function
//This is a basic formation of function in JavaScript:
function myfunction(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
console.log("The sum is: ", myfunction(4 , 4, 4,))

//Finding the average of 4 numbers:
function avg(a,b,c,d) {
    return (a + b + c + d) / 4;
}
console.log("The average of these numbers is: " + avg(6,3,5,7))

// ** One thing to remember "In JS,the division of two numbers may comes floating number.we don't have to convert the type."
